        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>¼ cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh blueberries</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons orange zest</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat</strong> the air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
            <li><strong>Stir</strong> together flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Cut in butter with 2 knives or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li><strong>Beat</strong> egg with a fork in a small bowl. Remove 2 tablespoons egg to another small bowl; set aside. Add buttermilk and vanilla extract to remaining egg; whisk with the fork until combined. Stir into flour mixture until just moistened. Gently stir in blueberries.</li>
            <li><strong>Transfer</strong> dough to a lightly floured surface. Gently knead until dough is no longer sticky, about 8 to 10 strokes. Pat dough into a 6-inch circle. Cut into 8 wedges, without separating, dipping the knife in flour between cuts.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine</strong> remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and orange zest in a small bowl. Brush top of dough with reserved egg and sprinkle with sugar mixture. Separate dough wedges and carefully arrange them, using a small wide spatula, in a single layer in the fryer basket, in batches if necessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook</strong> scones until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
